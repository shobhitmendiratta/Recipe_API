# Recipe_API_Django_AWS

Developed a comprehensive REST API employing Test-Driven Development. The project involved setting up the environment with Docker and GitHub Actions, creating and managing endpoints for users, tags, ingredients, recipes, and additional metadata such as cooking times and dietary tags (e.g., "comfort food," "vegan," "dessert"). Implemented image uploading and filtering functionalities for list endpoints. Deployed the solution to an AWS server, ensuring robust functionality through extensive unit testing. The backend was engineered using Python, Django, Django REST Framework, Docker, GitHub Actions, and PostgreSQL.
